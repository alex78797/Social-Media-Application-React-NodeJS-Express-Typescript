// SCENARIO: if multiple requests get fired and the access token is not valid
// all of them will get 403 as a response and all of them will try to refresh an access token
// which will result in the first one being successful and other ones will fail
// and then the user is navigated to log in screen.

// ----> use a mutex

// mutex is locked <---> another request already returned a 403 and the access token is being refreshed

// If there is an auth error, either
// - lock the mutex to try to make a request for an auth token,
//   and then retry the original query (because now the user is probably authenticated again)
// - wait for the already locked mutex (after that, a reauth will have taken place)
//   and then retry the original query (because now the user is probably authenticated again)
